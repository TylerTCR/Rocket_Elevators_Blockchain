## Project Description
For this week, we were tasked to create NFTs and a front-end website to mint said NFTs.
I implemented a pre-sale for whitelisted users, allowing those users to mint with a discount before the official sale.
We were to also include reveal functionality for the NFTs themselves, showing the actual image after 9:00 AM on December 27, 2021.
On top of paying with ETH, Rocket Elevators has it's own token that can be used to pay for the NFTs instead. Finally, we were to include TDD tests.

## The Site
To run the site locally, you'll have to clone/download this repo onto your machine.

After doing so, make sure you have node.js installed, then run this in the command line:

```sh
npm install
```

Now you're ready to run the site locally, simply execute this:

```sh
npm run start
```

Or, you can visit the <a href="https://rocketvators-nft.herokuapp.com/">live site</a>

## Mining ETH and LINK
To mine ETH or LINK, you must go here: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby

Now simply follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Select ```Ethereum Rinkeby``` in the Network dropdown</li>
  <li>Copy your testnet account address and paste it in the corresponding textbox</li>
  <li>Select the type(s) you want to mine (ETH / LINK)</li>
  <li>Check the "I'm not a robot" and send the request</li>
  <li>You're done, just wait for it to finish mining and you're good to go</li>
  (optional)<li>To mine more, just repeat steps 3 and 4</li>
</ol>

## Running TDD Tests
To run the TDD test simply run the follow command in the terminal
```sh
npm 
```
